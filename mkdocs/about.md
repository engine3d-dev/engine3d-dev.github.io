# About TheAtlasEngine

Still in progress 🚧

Atlas started as a 2D interactive game engine that was built just for fun and to have a fun way of seeing how game engines are made. Using them to build fun games.

Then Aaron (creator) of the project decided to on making this project now focused in 3D. Where it gives students the opportunities to work on a cool project. Then being able to seeing some great results and using them during game jam events.

One of the most satisfying factors of building this project is being able to use them during game jams and submitting games developed by this engine. That is the feeling he wants to share with other students.
