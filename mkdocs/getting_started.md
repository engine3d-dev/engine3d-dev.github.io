# ðŸ“š Getting Started

## ðŸ’¥ Prerequisites

These are needed before working to get TheAtlasEngine building successfully on your platform.

* `python`: 3.12 or above
* `conan`: 2.10.0 or above
* `llvm`: 17 or above
* `CMake` Build tool for the project
* `git`: Version control

=== "Windows"

    !!! info

        Needs to install Visual Studio's installer before using the `winget` command

        Visual studio is required only on Windows for getting C++ to work

    Run this `winget` command to setup C++ with Visual Studio installer in powershell (in admin mode)

    ```powershell
    winget install Microsoft.VisualStudio.2022.BuildTools --override "--add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.VCTools --includeRecommended -p --installWhileDownloading"
    ```

    It is recommended to use Choco for an easy installation process on Windows.
    
    To install `choco`, open powershell with admin access and run the following command in your terminal (powershell must be admin):
    
    ```powershell
    Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
    ```
    
    !!! tip
        If `choco` command does not work after running this script try closing and reopening powershell again.
        When `choco` prompts you to run install scripts from the commands below, enter `all` so it can install everything.
    
    Install `git` (powershell must be admin):
    ```powershell
    choco install git
    ```
    
    Install `python` (powershell must be admin):
    ```powershell
    choco install python --version=3.12.0
    ```
    
    Install `llvm` (powershell must be admin):

    !!! error
        If you get this error make sure that your environment variable is set to LLVM's clang.exe and clang++.exe filepath.

        While also making sure 
        
        ```
        CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:2 (project):
        The CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER:

            C:/Program Files/LLVM/bin/clang++.exe

        is not a full path to an existing compiler tool.
        ```

    ```powershell
    choco install llvm
    ```
    
    Install `conan` (powershell must be admin)
    ```powershell
    pip install "conan>=2.10.2"
    ```

    Install cmake and make

    !!! error
        you can get this error if you DO NOT have 'make' installed via choco

        ```
        CMake Error: CMake was unable to find a build program corresponding to "Unix Makefiles".  CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM is not set.  You probably need to select a different build tool.
        ```
    
    !!! error
        you can get this error if you DO NOT have 'mingw' installed via choco

        CMake Error: CMake was unable to find a build program corresponding to "MinGW Makefiles".  CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM is not set.  You probably need to select a different build tool.

    ```powershell
    choco install make cmake
    ```

    !!! info

        mingw is installed because we need `mingw32-make.exe` as dependencies will default to using "MinGW Makefiles" generator specified.
        which means that their CMake will look for `mingw32-make.exe` specific make executables instead of `make.exe`

    Install mingw
    ```powershell
    choco install mingw
    ```

    [comment]: <> (Vulkan Installer can be found here [here](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home#windows))

    !!! info

        Using this `winget` command will install Vulkan's installer, set it up for you, and set the environment path variable.
    
    Installing Vulkan's installer from the terminal in powershell. (in admin mode)
    ```powershell
    winget install --id=KhronosGroup.VulkanSDK -e
    ```

    !!! tip
        Once you have completely finish installing. DONT FORGET to refresh your powershell before building the TheAtlasEngine project.


=== "Ubuntu 20.0+"

    Install wget if it isn't already on your system

    `sudo apt-get install wget`

    Install the latest version of `llvm`
    
    ``` bash
    wget https://apt.llvm.org/llvm.sh
    chmod +x llvm.sh
    sudo ./llvm.sh
    ```

    Install LLVM's C+ standard library (this will use the llvm apt repos)

    ```bash
    sudo apt install libc++-17-dev libc++abi-17-dev
    ```

    Installing Linux Prerequisites

    ```bash
    sudo apt install -y lsb-release wget software-properties-common gnupg libgtk2.0-dev libgl1-mesa-dev
    sudo apt-get install -y libx11-dev libx11-xcb-dev libfontenc-dev libice-dev libsm-dev libxau-dev libxaw7-dev libxt-dev libxtst-dev libxrender-dev libxrandr-dev libxi-dev
    sudo apt install -y software-properties-common

        ```
    
    Install pipx which is used to install conan

    ```bash
    sudo apt install pipx
    ```

    Installing conan

    ```bash
    pipx install "conan>=2.10.1"
    ```

    !!! tip

        On linux vulkan is not needed to be installed, conan handles that


=== "MacOS X"

    Install Homebrew:
    
    ```
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

    ```
    
    Install Rosetta (only required for M1 macs):
    
    ```
    /usr/sbin/softwareupdate --install-rosetta --agree-to-license
    ```

    !!! info

        metal-cpp does not need to be installed because conan handles this for you

---

# ðŸ“¦ Setting up Conan

Install host profiles for your specific platforms

=== "Windows"

    If you are on an x86 architecture for Windows.
    
    ```powershell
    conan config install -sf profiles/x86_64/Windows/ -tf profiles https://github.com/engine3d-dev/conan-config.git
    ```

=== "X86 Linux"

    If you are on a linux platform that uses an x86 architecture.
    
    ```bash
    conan config install -sf profiles/x86_64/linux/ -tf profiles https://github.com/engine3d-dev/conan-config.git
    ```

=== "M1 Mac"

    If you are on an M1 Mac OS.

    ```zsh
    conan config install -sf profiles/armv8/mac/ -tf profiles https://github.com/engine3d-dev/conan-config.git
    ```

---

## ðŸ“¥ Getting project repositories from Artifactory

Add the engine3d-conan repository to your system. This repository holds all of the TheAtlasEngine packages.

```zsh
conan remote add engine3d-conan https://libhal.jfrog.io/artifactory/api/conan/engine3d-conan
```

## âœ… Development Environment Completed!!

Once the development environment is completed. Then go to the [repos](https://github.com/engine3d-dev) to see the list of repositories that you plan to contribute to.


## **Changing Build Type**

The build type determines level of optimizations for the project you are building for. TheAtlasEngine by default is Release is because performance is one of the most important aspects of the project.

You can change `build_type` to the following types:

* `Debug`: Turns on some optimizations to reduce binary size and improve performance while still maintaining the structure to make debugging easier. Recommended for testing and prototyping.

* `Release`: Turns on optimizations and favors high-performance optimizations over space-saving optimizations.

* `MinSizeRel`: Turns on optimizations and favor higher space saving optimizations over higher-performance.

!!! tip
    
    -b missing is only used during your first build.

    ```
    conan build . -b missing -s build_type=Debug
    ```

This is how you can specify build types when building with conan:

```
conan build . -s build_type=Debug
```
